# Usage
Here are some instructions on how to use the code and resources provided in this repository:

[**Data Inconsistency**](https://github.com/tawfikhammad/Data-cleaning-tutorial/tree/main/Inconsistency): This section provides techniques and code snippets to identify and handle inconsistent data. Refer to Data Inconsistency for detailed information.

[**Parsing Dates**](https://github.com/tawfikhammad/Data-cleaning-tutorial/tree/main/Parsing%20Dates): If you need to parse dates from different formats, check out Parsing Dates for code examples and guidelines.

[**Data Transformation**](https://github.com/tawfikhammad/data-cleaning/tree/main/data%20transformation):

* **`Log Transformation`**: Learn how to apply a logarithmic transformation to your data using the techniques outlined in Log Transformation.
* **`Square Root Transformation`**: Explore the benefits of applying a square root transformation to your data. Refer to Square Root Transformation for more information.
* **`Box Cox Transformation`**: Understand how the Box Cox transformation can help normalize your data. Find implementation details in Box Cox Transformation.

[**Handling Outliers**](https://github.com/tawfikhammad/Data-cleaning-tutorial/tree/main/Handle%20Outliers): Discover effective methods for detecting and handling outliers in your dataset. See Handling Outliers for code examples and recommendations.

[**Imputation**](https://github.com/tawfikhammad/Data-cleaning-tutorial/tree/main/Imputation):
Imputation methods aim to estimate the missing values based on the available information in the dataset.
